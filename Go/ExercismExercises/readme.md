These are my solutions for some programming exercises written in Go. These exercises can be found at Exercism platform. 
They may be slightly modified in order to work locally, because I implemented them in an online editor Exercism provides.
This folder contains some subfolders. Each subfolder is a concept I learned about the Go language. Inside each subfolder there are some
exercises about that concept.
