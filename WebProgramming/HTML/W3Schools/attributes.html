        <!--HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
        
        All HTML elements can have attributes
        Attributes provide additional information about elements
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

        The href Attribute
        The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
        -->

        <a href="https://uom.gr">Visit UoM</a>

        <!--
        The src Attribute
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed
        -->
        <img src="C:\Users\thano\Pictures\Wallpapers\street_city_sunset_160055_1920x1080.jpg">

        <!--
            There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute
            
            1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
            Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

            Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, 
            you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; 
            it can suddenly be removed or changed.

            2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does 
            not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. 
            Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

            Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

        <!--
        The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):
        -->

        <br>

        <img src="C:\Users\thano\Pictures\Wallpapers\street_city_sunset_160055_1920x1080.jpg" width="300" height="200">

        <br>

        <!--
            The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason 
            cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
            In the following html element there is an error in src attribute just to display the alt text
        -->

        <img src="C:\Users\thano\Pictures\Wallpapers\street_city_sunset_160055_1920x1010.jpg" alt="A city in USA">


        <!--The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. -->
        <p style="color: blue;" >This is a blue paragraph</p>

        <!--You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, 
        to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
        Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the 
        language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.
        -->

        <!--
            The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
            The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element
        -->

        <p title="A random title">This is another paragraph</p>

        <!--
            TIP
            We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values
            The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

            However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

            GOOD
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>

            BAD
            <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a>

            Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:
            <p title=About W3Schools>

            Single or Double Quotes?
            Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

            In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

            <p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
            Or vice versa:
            <p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
