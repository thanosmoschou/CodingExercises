        <!--BRIEF THEORY-->
        <!--An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

        The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
        <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname> 

        Examples:
        
        Start tag	Element content	        End tag
        <h1>	    My First Heading	    </h1>
        <p>	        My first paragraph.	    </p>
        <br>	    none	                none

        Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. 
        Empty elements do not have an end tag!

        HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

        All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>

        </body>
        </html>

        The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.

        It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.

        Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element

        The <body> element defines the document's body.

        It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.

        Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>

        The <h1> element defines a heading.

        It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>

        The same for paragraph <p> and </p>

        Never Skip the End Tag

        HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

        The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
        <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
