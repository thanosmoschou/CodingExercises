            The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
            You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.
            
            The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

            The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. 
            It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

            The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

            In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name "myHeader". 
            This <h1> element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section

            Note: The id name is case sensitive!

            Note: The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).

            A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page
