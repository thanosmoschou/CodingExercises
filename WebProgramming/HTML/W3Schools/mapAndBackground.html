            The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. 
            The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.

            The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.
            To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.

            The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:
            <img src="C:\Users\thano\Pictures\Wallpapers\street_city_sunset_160055_1920x1080.jpg" alt="city" usemap="#citymap">
            
            The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a 
            relationship between the image and the image map.
            Tip: You can use any image as an image map!

            Then, add a <map> element.

            The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute:
            <map name="citymap">
            
            The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute.

            Then, add the clickable areas.

            A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

            You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

            rect - defines a rectangular region
            circle - defines a circular region
            poly - defines a polygonal region
            default - defines the entire region
            You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image. 

            The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.
            Example
            <area shape="rect" coords="34, 44, 270, 350" href="computer.htm">
            
            This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "computer.htm":
            
            To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle(2 values)
            Then specify the radius of the circle(1 value)

            <area shape="circle" coords="337, 300, 44" href="coffee.htm">
            
            The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).
            This can be used to create any shape.
            The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis:
            
            A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function.
            Add a click event to the <area> element to execute a JavaScript function

            <map name="workmap">
            <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" href="coffee.htm" onclick="myFunction()">
            </map>

            <script>
            function myFunction() {
            alert("You clicked the coffee cup!");
            }
            </script>

        <img src="C:\Users\thano\Pictures\Wallpapers\street_city_sunset_160055_1920x1080.jpg" alt="city"
        style="width:600px;height:700px;" usemap="#citymap">

        <map name="citymap">
            <area shape="rect" coords="250 250 400 400" title="car">
        </map>

            A background image can be specified for almost any HTML element.
            To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:

            <p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">

            You can also specify the background image in the <style> element, in the <head> section:

            <style>
                p {
                    background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
                }
            </style>

            If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the <body> element:

            <style>
                body {
                    background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
                }
            </style>

            If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, 
            until it reaches the end of the element

            To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.
            background-repeat: no-repeat;

            If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

            Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed
            This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions)

            <style>
                body {
                    background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
                    background-repeat: no-repeat;
                    background-attachment: fixed;
                    background-size: cover;
                }
            </style>
            
            If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:
            Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, but always cover the entire element.
