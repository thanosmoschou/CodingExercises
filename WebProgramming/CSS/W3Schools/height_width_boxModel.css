The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.
The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. 
It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.

The height and width properties may have the following values:

auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
length - Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
% - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value

The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, 
or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

The problem occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (for example 500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.

Note: If you for some reason use both the width property and the max-width property on the same element, 
and the value of the width property is larger than the max-width property; the max-width property will be 
used (and the width property will be ignored).

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

Width and Height of an Element
In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works.

Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width 
and height of the content area. To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.

div{
    width: 300px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 30px solid black;
    margin: 0px;
}

/*
The above div has a width of
300px of content+20px of padding(10+10) + 60px of border(30+30) + 0px of margin = 380px total width

The total width of an element should be calculated like this:
Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin

The total height of an element should be calculated like this:
Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin
