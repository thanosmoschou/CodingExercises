Keep in mind that:

If you create a .java file with some code inside that modifies a file then:

If you specify just a filename like "file.txt"
it will be created in the same folder with your .java file.

If you create an Eclipse project and you specify just a filename like "file.txt"
it will be created in the project's folder (not inside the src folder)
