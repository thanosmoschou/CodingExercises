/*
When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements.

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).

An element can have a positive or negative stack order

Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) 
and flex items (elements that are direct children of display: flex elements).

If two positioned elements overlap each other without a z-index specified, the element defined last in the HTML code will be shown on top.
*/

img{
    position: absolute;
    left: 0px;
    top: 550px;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    z-index: -3;
}


/*
The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.

The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.

The overflow-x and overflow-y properties specifies whether to change the overflow of content just horizontally or vertically (or both):

overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.


  overflow-x: hidden; Hide horizontal scrollbar
  overflow-y: scroll; Add vertical scrollbar
