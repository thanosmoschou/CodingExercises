            The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
            Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

            The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a 
            JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

            In the following example we have a <div> element with a class attribute with the value of "city". 
            All of the <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section
        -->

        <div class="city">
            <h1>Heading</h1>
            <p>This is a random paragraph</p>
            <a href="https://uom.gr" target="_blank">Visit UoM</a>
        </div>

        <!--
            In the following example we have a <span> element with a class attribute with the value of "note". 
            Those <span> elements will be styled equally according to the .note style definition in the head section
        -->
        <p>This is also <span class="note">a random paragraph</span></p>

        <!--
            Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
            Note: The class name is case sensitive!

            The Syntax For Class
            To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}

            Multiple Classes
            HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

            To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. 
            The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.

            In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the note class, 
            and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes

            Different Elements Can Share Same Class
            Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.

            In the following example, both <h2> and <p> point to the "city" class and will share the same style:
        -->
        <h2 class="city note">This is also a random heading</h2>

        <h2 class="city">Another heading</h2>
        <p class="city">Another paragraph</p>
