            HTML Headings
            HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

            <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

        <h1>First</h1>
        <h2>Second</h2>

        <h4>Fourth</h4>
        <h5>Fifth</h5>
        <h6>Sixth</h6>

        Headings Are Important
        Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

        Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

        <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

        Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

        <!--
            Bigger Headings
            Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style 
            attribute, using the CSS font-size property

        <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">Heading 1</h1>

            REMINDER
            <html> defines the root of the html document
            <body> defines the document's body
            <h1> to <h6> defines html headings
