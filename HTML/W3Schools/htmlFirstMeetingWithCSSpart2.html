            External CSS
            An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
            To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page
            The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, 
            and must be saved with a .css extension.
